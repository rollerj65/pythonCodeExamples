# pythonCodeExamples

Hi,

Welcome to my pythonCodeExamples project. I am a non-senior software developer looking to catch up on programming languages I have missed. In this project you can find code samples that I used to resolve ProjectEuler.net problems (some are still in progress), as well as code samples of python walkthroughs that I have gone through.

Thanks,
Jacob
